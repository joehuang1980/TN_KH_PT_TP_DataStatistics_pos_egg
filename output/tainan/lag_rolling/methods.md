### Temporal Lag Effect Analysis

To assess temporal relationships between environmental variables and mosquito
activity, we analyzed correlation patterns across 1-12 week lag
intervals. Two types of temporal features were examined: (1) simple lag features,
representing values from t-n weeks prior, and (2) rolling window features,
representing moving averages from t-n to t weeks.

For each environmental variable (high/mean/low temperature, rainfall, and NDVI),
Spearman correlations were calculated between lag features and outcome variables
(POS and EGG) at each weekly interval. The optimal lag period was identified as
the interval with the highest absolute correlation coefficient. This analysis
was performed separately for each city to account for regional differences in
mosquito lifecycle dynamics and environmental response times.

Correlation patterns were visualized using heatmaps (features × lag weeks) and
line plots (correlation strength × lag period). Significance was assessed using
two-tailed tests with p < 0.05 threshold.
