### Cross-City Comparison Analysis

Statistical comparisons across 4 cities were performed to identify
universal versus city-specific predictors of mosquito activity. Outcome variable
distributions (POS and EGG) were compared using Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, followed
by Dunn's post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons.

Feature importance rankings were compared across cities by calculating Spearman
correlations between each city's ranked feature lists. Universal predictors were
defined as features meeting two criteria in all cities: (1) |ρ| > 0.3
and (2) p < 0.001. City-specific predictors
were defined as features meeting these criteria in only one or two cities.

Clustering patterns (optimal k and cluster-outcome relationships) and temporal
lag effects (optimal lag periods) were also compared across cities to identify
consistent versus location-specific patterns.
