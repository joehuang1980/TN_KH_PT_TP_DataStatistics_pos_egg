### Statistical Correlation Analysis

Spearman rank correlation coefficients (ρ) were calculated between 175
environmental and demographic features and two outcome variables: ovitrap positive
rate (POS) and average egg count (EGG), for each city independently. Spearman's
method was chosen due to its robustness to non-normal distributions and outliers,
which are common in ecological surveillance data.

Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed tests with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.000286, derived from family-wise
error rate of 0.05 divided by 175 tests). Features were ranked by
absolute correlation strength, and the top 20 positive and negative correlations
were identified for each outcome variable.

Features were categorized into four groups for interpretation: (1) temperature
variables (high, mean, and low temperature with temporal lags), (2) rainfall
variables (precipitation with temporal lags), (3) vegetation indices (NDVI mean,
median, and sum with temporal lags), and (4) demographic variables (population
characteristics).
